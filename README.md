###Code Challenge: The Weather app###
* You want to develop an iPhone application for weather forecasts using API available at www.worldweatheronline.com. You’ll have to register to their free tier and include the API key in your code challenge.

Here’s a list of wanted features:
• User shall be able to search, select and add a named city to a list
• Items on the list can be selected and a detail screen with the city forecasts should be displayed. • A way to get back to the city list shall be available.

* If in doubt consider the standard iOS weather app as a model.


### Functionality ###
** Screen 1: Locations Screen: ** This page will show a list of all the locations that have been added. Tapping on a location will bring the user to Screen 2 which fetches and displays the weather forecast. 
A user is able to delete any location by swiping on it and tapping the delete button. 

** Screen 1bis: Location Search: **Tapping on the search bar activates the search function which allows the user to add a new location. 

** Screen 2: Forecast Screen: ** This screen will show the weather forecast of a specific location.
